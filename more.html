    <div class="about">
        <h2>When was N.O.V.A.L. founded?</h2>
        <p>N.O.V.A.L. (Next-gen Omniversal Virtual Advanced Leisure) was founded in 2074 by Edward Johannes, a visionary who found current video games boring and uninspired. His dream was to create an entertainment system that transcended conventional gaming and allowed people to explore limitless virtual worlds with unparalleled realism.</p>
        
        <h2>Why You Should Buy the Reality Replication Machine (RRM)</h2>
        <p>The Reality Replication Machine (RRM) is the flagship product of N.O.V.A.L. It allows you to step into any possible reality, experience godly powers, and immerse yourself in infinite virtual worlds without leaving the comfort of your home. Whether you're seeking adventure, power, or just an escape, the RRM offers it all.</p>
        
        <h2>The Administrators</h2>
        <p>The leaders of N.O.V.A.L. are known as the "Administrators." They are highly skilled individuals with expertise in technology, virtual environments, and digital experiences. The Administrators oversee the development and management of the Reality Replication Machine, ensuring that the experiences are seamless and secure. They work tirelessly to ensure that every user's experience is uninterrupted by external factors.</p>

        <h2>How the RRM Works</h2>
        <p>The RRM doesn't send you to another universe; rather, it simulates a virtually limitless number of alternate realities. These simulated worlds are built with hyper-realistic environments, AI, and interactions. Players gain godlike powers in each of these simulated realities and can explore, fight, or live out any fantasy they've ever imagined. You are free to explore as long as you wish, but your experience will not be interrupted from the outside world. </p>

        <h2>The Cost</h2>
        <div class="cost">
            <p><strong>Cost of the RRM: $99,999.99</strong></p>
        </div>
        <p>The cost of a single Reality Replication Machine is steep, but the experience is worth every penny. You’re not just buying a product – you’re buying a new life, new possibilities, and a virtually endless world of entertainment.</p>
        

        <h2>Why N.O.V.A.L. Is Revolutionizing Entertainment</h2>
        <p>Current entertainment systems only scratch the surface of what’s possible. With N.O.V.A.L.'s Reality Replication Machine, you're no longer bound by limits. Whether you're exploring medieval castles, futuristic cities, or alien planets, the possibilities are limitless. The machine adapts to your desires, and the only limit is your imagination.</p>
        
        <h2>The Future of Virtual Reality</h2>
        <p>As technology continues to evolve, N.O.V.A.L. plans to enhance the Reality Replication Machine with even more features, including full sensory immersion, AI companions, and endless updates to the simulated realities. With N.O.V.A.L., you’re not just playing a game – you're living an adventure.</p>
